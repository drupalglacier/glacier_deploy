 * Fast 404 pages:
 *
 * Drupal can generate fully themed 404 pages. However, some of these responses
 * are for images or other resource files that are not displayed to the user.
 * This can waste bandwidth, and also generate server load.
 *
 * The options below return a simple, fast 404 page for URLs matching a
 * specific pattern:
 * - 404_fast_paths_exclude: A regular expression to match paths to exclude,
 *   such as images generated by image styles, or dynamically-resized images.
 *   If you need to add more paths, you can add '|path' to the expression.
 * - 404_fast_paths: A regular expression to match paths that should return a
 *   simple 404 page, rather than the fully themed 404 page. If you don't have
 *   any aliases ending in htm or html you can add '|s?html?' to the expression.
 * - 404_fast_html: The html to return for simple 404 pages.
 *
 * Add leading hash signs if you would like to disable this functionality.
